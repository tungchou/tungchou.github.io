</p><h1 align="CENTER">Review Guidelines for PKC 2016</h1>

<h2 class="western">Schedule</h2>
<p><b>October 6 to October 10:</b> 
PC members enter their reviewing preferences</p>
<p><b>October 13 to November 12:</b> 
Individual review. Reviewers do not
communicate with each other about the submissions. Please enter all
the assigned reviews by the deadline.</p>
<p><b>November 13 to December 5: </b>
Discussion phase. Reviewers can see each
other′s reviews and discuss them using the review web site. Many
decisions about acceptance and rejection made during this period. </p>
<p><b>December 6 to December 10: </b>
Decisions are finalized on all submissions. </p>
<p><b>December 11:</b> Notification to authors. 

</p><h2 class="western">Assignments</h2>
<p>Most submissions are assigned to three reviewers (except PC-member
papers that are assigned to more reviewers). Of course, you are
allowed (and encouraged) to review papers that were not assigned to
you, but please do so only after you reviewed your assigned lot. The
chair(s) may also ask you to review additional submissions if the
need arises. </p>

<h2 class="western">External reviewers</h2>
<p>You are encouraged to ask others outside the committee to help
evaluate the papers. External readers should apply the usual
confidentiality rules for conference submissions, in particular, not
to distribute the paper to other people. It may be necessary to
adjust an outside referee′s score to make it compatible with your
own system. You should understand the paper and external readers′
comments well enough that you can discuss them in the public
discussions phase. Please mark the names of the external reviewers in
the subreferee box on the review form. After the final decision, the
chair(s) will send out a list of all the sub-reviewers so you can
check that none of your sub-reviewers were forgotten.<br><i>Do not
forward your account name and password to a subreferee</i>. The
review site contains very sensitive information. The program
committee discussions should remain confidential within the program
committee. 
</p>
<h2 class="western">Writing a Report</h2>
<p><a name="grades"></a>Each reviewer assigns a grade (1-6) to each
reviewed paper to reflect the recommendation on acceptance/rejection
for the paper, as well as a weight (1-3) to reflect the confidence of
the reviewer in the recommendation. Grades for other specific
criteria may also be entered. Please use the scale below when
completing the review form. 
</p>
<dl>

<h3 class="western">
Report contents</h3>
<p>Reports will consist of grades, a weight, and comments. The
comments should help the authors as well as other committee members
understand your opinions. Please don′t write one-line reviews and
don′t over-use committee-only comments. There is no need to copy
the comments to authors in the committee-only field. The bulk of the
report should be visible to the authors (including summary of
contributions, general evaluation, and specific comments). Authors of
rejected papers deserve to know why their papers were rejected, and
we want accepted papers to be improved based on our comments.<br><br>There
is no additional structure to the reports that you have to follow.
Here are a few points that you may want to refer to when organizing
and writing your report.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Summary of the problem and paper contribution. 
	</p>
	</li><li><p>What is best about the paper: new ideas, proofs,
	simplifications, formalizations, implementation, performance
	improvement, new insight, etc.</p>
	</li><li><p>What are the paper weaknesses: lack of originality, small
	increment over previous work, unsubstantiated claims, bad
	presentation, insufficient discussion of relation with prior work
	etc.</p>
	</li><li><p>Target audience: who will be interested in the results, who
	will be benefited from its publication in the proceedings, who will
	want to hear the talk at the conference.</p>
	</li><li><p>Summary of recommendation: Accept/Reject, main reason.</p>
	</li><li><p>Detailed technical comments.</p>
</li></ul>
<h2 class="western">Contacting authors</h2>
<p>If you need to contact the authors of a submission, you can do
this through the chairs.<!-- If you need to contact the authors of a submission, ask the chair(s) to contact them on your behalf. -->
</p>
<h2 class="western">The Discussion Phase</h2>
<p>Please use the web site discussion boards for the discussions (and
not the e-mail list); this will ensure that people who join in the
discussion later can follow its history. (Conversation on the
discussion boards are not accessible to program committee members who
are authors of the paper in question or otherwise have a conflict of
interest.) 
</p>
<p>Have fun.</p>
